SHOF theme for shopify.

SHOF is a real company for which i'm building this theme. It is highly personalized and it doesn't respect most of shopify practices shown in the Dawn theme because there is no need for it. This theme will never be published at shopify theme store.

What i used:

- Alpine.js (JS interactions)
- Tailwindcss (styles)
- Laravel Mix (webpack)

1. Install node.js
2. Install Shopify CLI
3. Open project npm i in terminal
4. Login to Store in Shopify CLI

To start the project open two terminals and run following commands:

1. npm run dev (shopify cli)
2. npm run laravel (webpack)
